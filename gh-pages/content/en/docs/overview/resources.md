## What is resources

Resources are the information collected by command launcher. One good example is the user name and password from the built-in `login` command.

Some of these information require user consent to access them, a command needs to explicitly request the access to these resources through the `requestedResources` property in the manifest.

Others are automatically passed to the command.

Command Launcher passes resources to managed command through environment variables. The naming convention is: COLA_[RESOURCE_NAME]. If you compiled command launcher to a different name, command launcher will pass an additional environment variable `[APP_NAME]_[RESOURCE_NAME]` to the managed command as well.

For example, the following snippet of manifest requests the resource `USERNAME` and `LOGIN_TOKEN`.

```yaml
pkgName: infra-management
version: 1.0.0
cmds:
  - name: create-pod
    ...
    requestedResources: [ "USERNAME", "LOGIN_TOKEN" ]

```

## User consent

Command launcher will pass the resources to the command on runtime through environment variables: `COLA_[RESOURCE_NAME]`, **ONLY IF** user has agreed to do so. This is done through a user consent process, with a prompt message for the first-time run of the command:

```text
Command 'create-pod' requests access to the following resources:
  - USERNAME
  - LOGIN_TOKEN

authorize the access? [yN]
```

The user consent will last for a specific period of time define in `user_consent_life` configuration.

## Access resources in your command

Once user grant the access to the requested resources, command launcher will pass the resources to the command in runtime through environment variable with naming convention: `COLA_[RESOURCE_NAME]`. Here is an example of bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

USERNAME=${COLA_USERNAME}
LOGIN_TOKEN=${COLA_LOGIN_TOKEN}
```
