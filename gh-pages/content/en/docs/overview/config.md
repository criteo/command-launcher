### extra remote configuration

Each extra remote must have a unique name, it is used to identify the command as part of the command full name. The example configuration looks like the following:

```json
{
    "extra_remotes": {
        "remote1": {
            "remote_base_url": "",
            "sync_policy": "always",
            "repository_dir": ""
        }
    }
}
```

| remote_base_url | string | the base url of the remote repository, it must contain a `/index.json` endpoint to list all available packages                                                             |
| sync_policy     | string | how often the repository is synched from its remote. Possible value: always, hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. (hourly, daily, weekly and monthly are supported in 1.14+) |
| repository_dir  | string | the absolute path of the local repository folder to keep the downloaded local packages                                                                                     |

> You don't need to manage these extra remote configurations by your self. Use the built-in `remote` command instead

## Change configuration

It is recommended to use the built-in `config` command to change the configurations. For duration type configurations, you can use `h`, `m`, and `s` to present hour, minute, and seconds. For example:

```bash
cola config user_consent_life 24h
```

set the user consent life to 24 hours.
