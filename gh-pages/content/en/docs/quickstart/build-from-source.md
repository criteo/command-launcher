## Why does the binary name matter?

Command launcher is designed for both enterprise and individual usage. According to your context, you might want to call it differently. For example, at Criteo, we call it "Criteo Dev Toolkit". The binary name is used for several default configurations, for example, command launcher home `$HOME/.[APP_NAME]`, additional resources environment prefix `[APP_NAME]_`, etc.

The default pre-built binary is call `cola` (**Co**mmand **La**uncher), which means that the default home folder is `$HOME/.cola` and the resources environment variables are all starts with `COLA_`.

Another pre-built binary is called `cdt` (Criteo Dev Toolkit), its home folder will be `$HOME/.cdt`, and its commands can access the resource environment variables with both prefix `COLA_` and `CDT_`.

> For compatibility concern, we highly recommend to reference resources in your command with prefix `COLA_`

To use a different name, you need to build command launcher from source and pass the desired short and long name to the build scripts.

## Build from source

Requirements: golang >= 1.17

You can build the command launcher with your prefered name (in the example: `Command Launcher`, a.k.a `cola`).

```shell
go build -o cola -ldflags='-X main.version=dev -X main.appName=cola -X "main.appLongName=Command Launcher"' main.go
```

Or simply call the `build.sh` scripts

```shell
./build.sh [version] [app name] [app long name]
```

## Run tests

```shell
go test -v ./...
```
