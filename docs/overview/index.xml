Command launcher is a small footprint, rich feature CLI management tool for both enterprise and individual CLI developers. It eases the command line tool development by providing built-in common functionalities like: monitoring, progressive rollout, auto-completion, credential management, and more to your commands.
Why a command launcher? #
At Criteo, we have many teams who provides command line applications for developers. These CLI providers repeatly handle the same features and functionalities for their CLI apps, such as auto-completion, credential management, release, delivery, monitoring, etc.</description></item><item><title>Built-in commands</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/built-in-commands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 18:41:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/built-in-commands/</guid><description>config #
Get or set command launcher configuration.
Use cdt config to list all configurations.
Use cdt config [key] to get one configuration.
Use cdt config [key] [value] to set one configuration.
completion #
Setup auto completion. See help to get instructions:

Command launcher synchronizes commands from the remote command repository. Commands are packaged into a package, then uploaded to remote command repository. The following diagram shows this architecture.

A remote command repository is a simple http server, with following endpoints:</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/config/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 20:21:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/config/</guid><description>List of configurations #
Config Name Type Description ci_enabled bool whether the CI mode is enabled or not command_repository_base_url string the base url of the remote repository, it must contain a /index.json endpoint to list the available pacakges command_update_enabled bool whether auto update managed commands or not dropin_folder string the absolute path of the dropin folder enabled_user_consent bool whether enable the user consent. Be caution, when set to false, all resources are allowed to pass to the managed commands.</description></item><item><title>Manifest.mf</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/manifest/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 19:02:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/manifest/</guid><description>What is a manifest.mf file? #
A manifest.mf file is a file located at the root of your command launcher package. It describes the commands packaged in the zip file. When cdt install a package, it read the manifest file and register the commands in the manifest file.
Format of manifest.mf #
manifest.mf is in JSON or YAML format. It contains 3 fields:
pkgName: a unique name of your package version: the version of your package cmds: a list of command definition, see command definition section Here is an example</description></item><item><title>Dropin package</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/dropin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 19:29:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/dropin/</guid><description>What is dropin package? and why do I need it? #
A dropin package is a package that are not managed by the remote repository. It is only available on the developer&amp;rsquo;s machine. It allows developers to integrate their own scripts/tools into command launcher to benefit the feature provided by the command launcher, for example, auto-complete, monitoring etc.
For example, you probably already has lots of shell scripts to maintain your infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Manage resources</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/resources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 19:21:34 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/resources/</guid><description>What is resources #
Resources are the information collected by command launcher. One good example is the user name and password from the built-in login command.
To access these information, a command needs to explicitly request the access to these resources through requestedResources property in the manifest.
For example, the following snippet of manifest requests the resource USERNAME and LOGIN_TOKEN.
pkgName: infra-management version: 1.0.0 cmds: - name: create-pod ... requestedResources: [ &amp;quot;USERNAME&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;LOGIN_TOKEN&amp;quot; ] User consent #
Command launcher will pass the resources to the command on runtime through environment variables: [APP_NAME]_[RESOURCE_NAME], ONLY IF user has agreed to do so.</description></item><item><title>Variable</title><link>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/variable/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 21:36:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://criteo.github.io/command-launcher/docs/overview/variable/</guid><description>The two common use cases of integrating commands in command launcher are:
Reference files that are located in the package itself Provide system/architecture-aware commands, for example, .sh script for linux, and .bat script for windows To cover these use cases, in certain fields of the manifest file, predefined variables can used in the field values.
Available Variables #
Variable Name Variable Description PackageDir The absolute path of the package Root Same as &amp;ldquo;PackageDir&amp;rdquo; variable Cache Same as &amp;ldquo;PackageDir&amp;rdquo; variable Os The OS, &amp;ldquo;windows&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;linux&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;darwin&amp;rdquo; Arch The system architecture: &amp;ldquo;arm64&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;amd64&amp;rdquo; Binary The binary file name of the command launcher Extension The system-aware binary extension, &amp;quot;&amp;quot; for linux, &amp;ldquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
