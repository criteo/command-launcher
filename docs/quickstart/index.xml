Copy the binary into your PATH.

Setup auto-completion # Command launcher will automatically handle auto completion for all sub commands. You need to setup it once:
Bash # $ source &amp;lt;(cdt completion bash) # To load completions for each session, execute once: # Linux: $ cdt completion bash &amp;gt; /etc/bash_completion.</description></item><item><title>Build from source</title><link>https://doks.netlify.app/docs/quickstart/build-from-source/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 17:34:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks.netlify.app/docs/quickstart/build-from-source/</guid><description>Why does the binary name matter? # Command launcher is designed for both enterprise and individual usage. According to your context, you might want to call it differently. For example, at Criteo, we call it &amp;ldquo;Criteo Dev Toolkit&amp;rdquo;. The binary name is used for several default configurations, for example, command launcher home $HOME/.[APP_NAME], resources environment prefix [APP_NAME]_, etc.
The pre-built binary is call cdt (Criteo Dev Toolkit), which means that the default home folder is $HOME/.</description></item></channel></rss>
